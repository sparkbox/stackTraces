# Stack Trace Practice

The purpose of this repo is to practice reading stack traces and debugging the problems.

## How to Use

Each problem is in a numbered folder. The numbers are simply for organization, they do not indicate any sort of difficulty level. Go into each folder and run `node [filename]`.

For example, to see the error generated by `1-undefined`:

```
$ cd 1-undefined
$ node undefined.js
```

## How to contribute

Want to help out? Great, just create a new folder with the next available number and an appropriate name. Put a `js` file in there that generates some sort of stack trace and then submit a PR. Your help is greatly appreciated.
